## ABOUT GLOBALLY NETWORKED LEARNING

GLOBALLY NETWORKED LEARNING
Globally networked learning (GNL) refers to an approach to research, learning, and teaching that enables students, faculty, and non-academic researchers from different locations around the world to participate in, and collaborate on, knowledge-making processes and concrete research projects. With the aid of various forms of technology - including but not limited to, learning management systems, video conferencing software and hardware, cloud computing and social media - they are brought together in a consortium to collaborate on projects that bring together the diverse perspectives of participants to produce a richer, more nuanced, understanding of the issue(s) at hand.
