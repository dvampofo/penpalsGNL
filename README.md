# Penpals - A secure communication platform for students interested in studying abroad

## ABOUT PENPALS

![Demo](https://github.com/dvampofo/penpalsGNL/blob/master/screenshot/Penpal1.jpg?raw=true)

Adhering to UX/UI engineering principles, my team and I developed a secure and responsive web platform where high school and university students and parents can securely communicate with university students participating in a study abroad program.

Encrypted (via OpenPGP.js) digital spaces are created between the inquisitive students/parents and student abroad where they can communicate through video (Twilio Inc. API) and text (Firebase API) in real time. Plus, they can even share and store files (pdfs, photos etc) in this space. Once they're done with the space, they can either save or delete the room (& the contents in it with a program called Datashredder).

With the cost of university increasing in N.America, this platform can be used as a recruitment/learning tool by non-North American universities in attracting students who want to have a global experience without huge debt or even by the tourism industry.

## WHAT IS GLOBALLY NETWORKED LEARNING (GNL)?

Globally networked learning (GNL) refers to an approach to research, learning, and teaching that enables students, faculty, and non-academic researchers from different locations around the world to participate in, and collaborate on, knowledge-making processes and concrete research projects. With the aid of various forms of technology - including but not limited to, learning management systems, video conferencing software and hardware, cloud computing and social media - they are brought together in a consortium to collaborate on projects that bring together the diverse perspectives of participants to produce a richer, more nuanced, understanding of the issue(s) at hand.
